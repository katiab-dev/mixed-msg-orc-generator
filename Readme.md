# Orc translation page: Random Generator of Orc Sentences, translated in English

This is a project from the Codecademy Back-End Engineer course. So far, I learnt HTML & CSS basics, as long as Javascript.

This is a generator of orc sentences, with their translation in English. The "generate sentence" button randomly selects a sentence and its translation from a pull of sentences. 

Sentences and translation are taken from Wowpedia. 

Note: Any feedback is welcomed as I am a beginer in coding. The project may evolve with my progression in the courses
